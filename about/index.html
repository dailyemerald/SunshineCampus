                <h1>About SunshineCampus</h1>

                <p>Emerald Media Group, the nonprofit independent newsroom at the University of Oregon, created the SunshineCampus campaign to support investigative reporting and public records research.</p>

                <p>The University of Oregon, like many other colleges and state agencies, has a policy of charging fees to access public records.</p>

                <p>Emerald readers have increasingly asked our student journalists to produce more serious public interest news. But as a small nonprofit company, the Emerald struggles to pay $100 or more to fulfill even small requests.</p>

                <p>Frank LoMonte, executive director at the Student Press Law Center, told <a href="http://www.registerguard.com/rg/news/local/30003759-75/records-public-student-stites-university.html.csp">The Register-Guard</a> that there’s a trend of university administrators making it more expensive to get access to open records.</p>

                <p>“Agencies have figured out that journalists don’t have the money to pay for public records, and they don’t have the time to file lawsuits, and so their default response is to cite some jackpot (dollar) amount that they know will be prohibitively large. It’s a way of discouraging people from being inquisitive,” LoMonte told The Register-Guard.</p>

                <strong>Do you want SunshineCampus in your newsroom? <a href="mailto:sstites@dailyemerald.com">Let us know</a>.</strong>

                <h2>The fine print</h2>

                Thank you for supporting independent student journalism. Before you make a donation, you may want to review our fundraising policies.
                
                <h3>Editorial independence</h3>
                
                <p>Our newsroom will have complete control over all editorial decisions, and donors should not expect to have any role in the selection of stories or coverage areas. We will be especially cautious with potential funders whose primary purpose is to further a specific political outcome, public policy or public opinion. Our newsroom reserves the right to decline a contribution for any reason.</p>

                <h3>Donor transparency</h3>

                <p>We will publicly disclose the name of each funder but not the amount of each donation. We will not accept anonymous donations.

                <h3>Tracking your impact</h3>

                <p>Every project that uses SunshineCampus funds will mention the support with the story in print and online. We’ll publish the complete file of public records once the story is published and the amount of money we spent from the fund on the project. We’ll also keep a log of all the stories on this site.</p>

                <h3>What donors receive</h3>
                
                <p>Donations are tax deductible. Each donor will receive a thank you note and letter to acknowledge our receipt of your support.</p>
